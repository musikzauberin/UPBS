# Skeleton of Ideas

Categories | Dataset | Source | Management | Visualisation | Analysis | Packages | Comments |
--- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
Biochemistry | Concentration of metabolites in cells| | Conversion of units? Mol to g/L | Concentration over time | Model fitting, t test bet diff cells? | Numpy/Scipy, ggplot | I dont really know whats there in Biochemistry... |
Biochemistry | Firing of neurons, [Na+], [K+]| | horizontal to vertical table, extracting subset of data from dataset| concentration over time, barplots | threshold of NA+/K+ for firing | 
Biochemistry | [photosynthesis substrates] or [circadian proteins] or [flowering proteins] vs amount of light || look at above biochemistry examples |
Behaviour | Monkey, time used for foraging, etc. | Behavioural Ecology Module | Dealing with NA and discrete time data | barplots or pie charts? | In the BE prac : if parvorders, age, species, social grouping affects behaviour || might want to do something different from BE module...
Conservation Ecology | Distribution of species | FYP of batchmates on trees in London parks| Location Data | Contour plots ? | any particular species more abundant..? |
Conservation Ecology | Climate data?
Ecology | Cricket mating | BE module | Poisson distributions | Barplots | t-test | |thinking up in process|
Ecology | Social behaviour & size of animal | | Categorical Data | Scatterplots | Do smaller animals tend to grp together more than larger animals? | | |
Genetics | Expression of Hox genes/ C. elegans Ras pathway / Arabidopsis morphology (Location and/or time) | NCBI GenBank/ for C.elegans, Arabidopsis: CDB module  | Python Pandas | Distance Matrix & Heatmap, Gene expression network | Cluster Analysis || might be too complicated
Evolutionary Biology | Haemoglobin genes/ribosomal genes | NCBI GenBank | Biopython | Phylogenetic tree of organisms based on haemoglobin genes ||| We might have done this in some module I cant remember where.|
