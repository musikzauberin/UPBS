# Skeleton of Ideas

Categories | Dataset | Source | Management | Visualisation | Analysis | Comments |
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------| ------------- |
Biochemistry | Concentration of metabolites over time | | Conversion of different units? Mol to g/L | Concentration over time, multiple metabolites/curves in the same plot, ggplot | Model concentration over time, fit model, minimal model | I dont really know whats there in Biochemistry... |
Biochemistry | Firing of neurons, [Na+], [K+], timing of depolarisation and hyperpolarisation | | horizontal to vertical table, extracting subset of data from dataset| concentration of electrolytes over time, or threshold of NA+/K+ required for firing of neurons | threshold of NA+/K+ required for firing of neurons | 
Biochemistry | Photosynthesis, [photosynthesis substrates] or [circadian proteins] or [flowering proteins] vs amount of light | look at above biochemistry examples |
Behaviour | Content in the second column
Conservation Ecology |
Ecology |
Genetics | Expression of Hox genes (Location and/or time) | NCBI GenBank | Python Pandas | Distance Matrix & Heatmap, Gene expression network | Cluster Analysis | might be too complicated
Evolutionary Biology | Haemoglobin genes | NCBI GenBank | Biopython | Phylogenetic tree of organisms based on haemoglobin genes |
